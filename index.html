		<p> I'm from Fresno California, and thanks to the panoramic I moved to Santa Cruz in my second year.  Currently a server at a tourist trap in Capitola,
			although we'll see how long that lasts, I like to keep a job on their toes LOL

			When I have free time I like being outdoors, going thrifting, or eating food.  </p>
