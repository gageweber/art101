		<p>Diamond and I are working together per usual! Partner besties for five-ever!!!</p>

						<h2> Challenges</h2>
						<p> The purpose of this lab is to work with a partner to experiment with loops. </p>
			</div>

			<div id = "problems">

						<h2> Problems </h2>
						<p> Some problems we faced when working on this lab. It was hard to understand the practical application
						of a loop until we were really getting into it.  It was also kinda difficult to get our java script to
					display when we would press the button. </p>
			</div>

			<div id = "results">

						<h3> Results </h3>
						<p> We created a basic loops to creat lists and displays words. I think that it turned out pretty good. On Monday,
						during the strike, we still came to our discussion section and no one else was there except for Emily, who was super
					helpful to us in figuring out our lab.-</p>
