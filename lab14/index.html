						<h2> Problems </h2>
						<p> Some problems we faced when working on this lab: When we did the labs the first time we didn't hesitate
						to ask for help or anounce that we didn't get something. As a result, most all of our labs function as they
					were intended and fufill their assigned requirements. This is a problem because it doesn't leave us much to debug. </p>

						<h3> Results </h3>
						<p> As I have said before, I have no interest in coding unfortunately, and am just taking this class to complete the
						Math and Formal Reasoning GE requiremnt.  Therefore I am perfectly satisfied with the labs I have submitted so far in this class.
					The lowest score we recieved was a 7.5/10, and to be so honest, thats literally fine with me.  I am here because I have to be. </p>
