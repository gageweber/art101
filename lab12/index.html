		<p>Diamond and I are working together per usual! Partner besties for five-ever!!!</p>

						<p> The purpose of this lab is to work with a partner to create a function that depends on conditionals. </p>

						<h2> Problems </h2>
						<p> Some problems we faced when working on this lab were getting the sorting to work correctly.  At first we had written
						an incorrect punctuation into the code, so we fumbled for a little bit until we figured it out. </p>

			<div id = "results">

						<h3> Results </h3>
						<p> We created a basic sorting hat to demonstrate a conditional function. I think that it turned out pretty good.</p>
